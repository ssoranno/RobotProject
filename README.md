# Line-Following Robot Project
Line-Following Robot C code used on a Digilent MX7 development board.<br>
This project was created for Microprocessor Systems class.

## Materials Required
1 PIC32MX7 Development Board<br>
4 IR sensors<br>
1 Digilent Robotics Kit<br>
2 Servo Motors<br>
1 PmodMIC (Digilent pmod microphone)<br>
2 Seven Segment Displays<br>
1 Digilent Pmod 8LD<br>

## MX7 Port Connections
The SSDs are attached to the top rows of ports JA & JB and the top rows of Ports JC & JD<br>
The Pmod 8LD is connected to port JF<br>
The IR sensors are connected to the top rows of port JE<br>
The 2 servo motors is connected to the bottom of port JD<br>

## Design Approach
This Robot uses the IR sensors to follow a black line on a white background.
